### Pane

This is the data structure that tabs or items live in. So when you are looking at the editor in Zed each tab that you see at the top of the screen is associated with an Item.

A Pane has a vector of Items.

### PaneGroup

This has to do with splitting the panes and it has an axis associated with it.
